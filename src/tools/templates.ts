## Your job

The worker that was handling this task crashed and did not come back within the grace window, so its pinned resume was never reclaimed. Pick an agent to take this work over and RE-DELEGATE it — do NOT execute it yourself, and do NOT leave routing to the default.

Use the crashed agent's identity above as context for who was on it and what kind of work it is. You may re-delegate to the same kind of agent, a peer, or whoever you judge appropriate — the choice is yours, but you MUST choose explicitly.

Dispatch via \`send-task\` with ALL of:
- an explicit \`agentId\` (the chosen worker) — REQUIRED. If you omit it, \`send-task\` auto-routes to the original task's agent, which is the dead worker, and the work re-strands.
- \`taskType: "resume"\`
- the tag \`resume-generation:{{generation_next}}\`
- \`parentTaskId: {{original_task_id}}\`
- do NOT inherit the original task's \`model\` (the new worker runs on its own).
